# SauceCon Parallel Testing Workshop

This directory contains example scripts and dependencies for the Parallel Testing Workshop. Use these scripts to test your Sauce Labs authentication credentials, setup your automated testing environment, try out Sauce Labs features, and complete the in-class Selenium examples. Download the zip file or clone the entire directory to your local environment.

#### For Demonstration Purposes Only

The code in these scripts is provided on an "AS-IS” basis without warranty of any kind, either express or implied, including without limitation any implied warranties of condition, uninterrupted use, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. These scripts are provided for educational and demonstration purposes only, and should not be used in production. Issues regarding these scripts should be submitted through GitHub. These scripts are maintained by the Technical Services team at Sauce Labs.

<br />

## Prerequisites

These procedures will show you to set up a Selenium environment for Java. The scripts in this repository allow you run a simple automated test to validate your Selenium environment and your [saucelabs.com](https://app.saucelabs.com/login) account credentials.

In order to participate in the hands-on portion of the workshop you must complete the following prerequisite installation and configuration steps:

* Install [Git](#install-git)
* Install [IntelliJ (or another IDE)](#install-intellij)
* Install [JDK](#install-the-jdk)
* Install [Maven](#install-maven)


[Project Setup](#setup-the-project) consists of the following steps:
* [Import the Project](#import-the-project)
* [Set Your Sauce Labs Credentials](#set-your-sauce-labs-credentials)
* [Run a Maven Test](#run-a-maven-test) 

***WARNING!*** In order to run the scripts and participate in this workshop you must have a valid 
[Sauce Labs account](https://app.saucelabs.com/signup) with the relevant amount of 
[VM concurrency](https://saucelabs.com/pricing). 

For this workshop, we will run between 1 and 40 threads simultaneously,
and while we understand that a free account won't give you enough concurrency to run these directly, the instructor
will adequately demonstrate the the system behavior. As long as you can execute even a single test against the Sauce
Labs platform with this code, you can have confidence that the code will scale to as many threads as you care to execute.

### Install Git

[Git](https://git-scm.com/doc) is a version control system that lets you check out code from a repository, 
work with that code on your own branch, and then merge that code with any changes that have been made by other developers. 
Git is an essential tool for distributed development teams, and is a critical component of the continuous 
integration/continuous development toolchain.

### Install Maven

Maven is a build automation and project management tool use for managing project builds, dependencies, and documentation. It uses a project object model (pom.xml) to manage Java-based projects. With our use case, it's very useful for configuring and managing test suites.

#### MacOSX:

1. Go to Maven Apache website and [download](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) the following package: `apache-maven-<version>-bin.tar.gz`
2. Extract the archive
    ```
    $ tar -xvf apache-maven-<version>-bin.zip
    ```
3. Add the `bin` directory of the extracted directory (`apache-maven-<version>`) to the `PATH` variable:
    ```
    $ export M2=$M2_HOME/bin
    $ export PATH=$M2:$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
    ```
    > ***WARNING!***: Make sure you've set `JAVA_HOME` othewise `mvn` commands won't run. For instructions on how to set `JAVA_HOME`, visit this [link](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19182-01/821-0917/inst_jdk_javahome_t/index.html)

4. Check to see if maven installed correctly:
    ```
    $ mvn -version
    ```

#### Windows:

1. Go to Maven Apache website and [download](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) the following package: `apache-maven-<version>-bin.zip`
2. Unpack the archive using an archive tool (for example WinZip)
3. Add the unpacked distribution’s `bin` directory to your user `PATH` environment variable by:
    1. Open up the system properties (WinKey + Pause) 
    2. Select the **Advanced** tab, and the **Environment Variables** button
    3. Add/Select the **`PATH`** variable in the user variables with the value:
        ```
        C:\Program Files\apache-maven-3.6.0\bin
        ```
4. Open a new command prompt (Winkey + R then type cmd) and run `mvn -v` to verify the installation.

### Setup the Project

#### Import the Project

1. Create a directory on your machine.
2. Clone this repository into said directory.
    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/saucelabs-training/saucecon19-parallel-workshop.git
    ```
2. Import the project into your IntelliJ (or IDE of your choice) as a **Maven Project**.
3. Click through the prompts, and confirm when it asks to **Import from Sources**
4. Choose the **saucedemo-parallel** directory as the **root** directory of the project.

#### Set Your Sauce Labs Credentials
1. Copy your Sauce Labs **username** and **accessKey** in the [User Settings](https://app.saucelabs.com/user-settings) section of the [Sauce Labs Dashboard](https://app.saucelabs.com/dashboard/builds).
2. Open a Terminal window (command prompt for Windows) and set your Sauce Labs Environment variables:   
   ###### Mac OSX:
   ```
   $ export SAUCE_USERNAME="username"
   $ export SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY="accessKey"
   ```
   ###### Windows:
   ```
   > set SAUCE_USERNAME="username"
   > set SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY="accesKey"
   ```
   > To set an environment variables permanently in Windows, you must append it to the `PATH` variable.
   
   > Go to **Control Panel > System > Windows version > Advanced System Settings > Environment Variables > System Variables > Edit > New**
   
   > Then set the "Name" and "Value" for each variable
   
9. Test the environment variables
    ###### Mac OSX:
    ```
    $ echo $SAUCE_USERNAME
    $ echo $SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY
    ```
    ###### Windows:
    ```
    > echo %SAUCE_USERNAME%
    > echo %SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY%
    ```
    
    > ***WARNING FOR UNIX USERS!***:
    > If you have problems setting your environment variables, try the following options:
    
    > ##### Option 1:
    Run the following commands in your terminal:
    ```

    > ##### Option 2:
    Refresh your bash session by running the following command: 
    ```
    $ source ~/.bashrc
    ``` 
    > ##### Option 3:
    Update **`.bash_profile`** to globally set environment variables. For example your file may look something like this:
    ```
    export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)
    export PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/bin"
    export PATH=$M2:$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
    export M2_HOME=/usr/local/apache-maven-<version>
    export M2=$M2_HOME/bin
    export SAUCE_USERNAME="xxx"
    export SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY="XXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXX"
    ```

#### Run a Maven Test
